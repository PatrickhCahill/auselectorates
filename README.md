A small repo designed to show how SA1s votes in the 2022 election for potential redistribution effects


## First draft of plan

### Get votes by SA1s

- ABS gives map of all the SA1s - With population data
- AEC gives the number of votes that polling place x voted in SA1 y.
  - Extrapolate from the result of that polling place to get a predicted SA1 vote score
  - Then we divide the SA1s into their current divisions to recreated the election results with SA1s

### Future Plans

- Find some convenient way to edit which SA1s are in which seat to see effects of redistribution
